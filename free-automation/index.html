        If we build something useful for you, chances are you'll come back when you need more help. 
        And if not? You still got something valuable.

        "This app has been a game changer for my warehouse and distribution center. Previously, all of our displays were inventoried on paper and no
        records were kept, causing us to lose track of displays easily. Using the app, we can now easily see our on-hands, shift inventory between
        warehouses to cover gaps, and keep more comprehensive records of what is coming into and going out of the branch. Highly recommend!"

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
    </section>
    <section class="content">
      <h3>What's the catch?</h3>
      <p>There isn't one. We build you something useful. You decide if you want to work with us in the future. That's it.</p>

      <h3>Do I have to pay hosting fees?</h3>
      <p>Not if you don't want to. We'll show you how to host it yourself (often for free on Google Apps Script or similar). Or we can host it for you for a small monthly fee.</p>

      <h3>What if I need changes later?</h3>
      <p>If you want to work with us ongoing, we charge $85/hour. If you want to make changes yourself, you have the code you can hire anyone.</p>

      <h3>How long does the free automation take?</h3>
      <p>Usually delivered within a week of our call. We keep it scoped to something we can build quickly but that's genuinely useful.</p>

      <h3>Is this only for big companies?</h3>
      <p>Nope. We work with businesses from 5 employees to 50+. If you have a time-consuming manual process, we can probably automate it.</p>

      <h3>What if my business is too unique?</h3>
      <p>That's actually better. Custom processes are where automation provides the most value. We'll figure it out on the call.</p>
