            <div class="project-details">
              <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Manufacturing client Ironsmith had 15 years of business-critical data locked in a legacy Microsoft Access
                system with a
                complex, inconsistent schema.</p>
              <p><strong>Task:</strong> Migrate hundreds of thousands of rows—many with broken or outdated relationships—into a modern AWS-hosted
                PostgreSQL database.</p>
              <p><strong>Action:</strong> We built a migration pipeline to extract CSV data from Access, clean and reconstruct
                relationships, validate against a local PostgreSQL schema, and deploy with a one command script to AWS.</p>
              <p><strong>Result:</strong> Seamless launch of their new system with all historical data intact and cleanly structured—no downtime, no
                data loss.</p>
              <div class="impact">
                A data pipeline that migrated 200K+ records across multiple tables with automated schema mapping and zero critical errors.

              <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Manufacturing client Ironsmith's previous agency left their modernization project incomplete, leaving
                critical gaps in
                business systems and no integration between their internal tools and customer website.</p>
              <p><strong>Task:</strong> Deliver an end-to-end solution: a custom business portal, an integrated WordPress site, a desktop app
                for on premise server file access, and a full migration from legacy systems.</p>
              <p><strong>Action:</strong> We built a cloud-based portal with complex quote workflows, developed a public-facing site synced to product
                data, created a desktop bridge app for opening server files in native programs, and migrated 15+ years of legacy data from Microsoft
                Access to
                PostgreSQL.</p>
              <p><strong>Result:</strong> Ironsmith now manages quotes, orders, and internal data seamlessly with full control over product
                presentation and file access on a new system that does not crash and has 24 hour support.</p>

              <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A home remodel company in Long Island used handwritten notes and manual spreadsheets to prepare quotes,
                often taking multiple days to finalize and send estimates to clients.</p>
              <p><strong>Task:</strong> Maintain the flexibility of Google Sheets but drastically reduce turnaround time and deliver polished,
                professional PDFs that matched the company's branding.</p>
              <p><strong>Action:</strong> We built a custom quoting system with all their product and pricing data, a script that auto-generates a
                filled out, branded PDF from the company's Google Sheet estimate, pulling in all data and line items seamlessly.</p>
              <p><strong>Result:</strong> What used to take days now takes just a from a few minutes to at most a couple hours. The company sends out
                professional estimates with a very budget friendly price tag.</p>
              <div class="impact">

              <p><strong>Task:</strong> Create a seamless bridge between a modern web portal and an on-site file server without sacrificing cloud
                benefits.</p>
              <p><strong>Action:</strong> We built a lightweight Python desktop app using PyQT that could be triggered from the browser, enabling
                users to open local folders in File Explorer and launch native apps like AutoCAD.</p>
              <p><strong>Result:</strong> Users retained critical desktop file access while benefiting from all the advantages of a modern web-based

              <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A contractor was juggling lead data between Angi, Facebook, Google Forms, and their quote creation
                software. Manual entry slowed down their team and introduced errors sometimes even causing them to miss incoming leads.</p>

              <p><strong>Task:</strong> Seamlessly integrate incoming leads from Google Forms and Angi into their CRM (Pipedrive), while ensuring all
                systems—including Slack and their custom quoting tool received the relevant data automatically.</p>

              <p><strong>Action:</strong> We built an integration pipeline that connects Google Forms and Angi's API to Pipedrive. From there, the
                data flows into their internal quote management system and triggers Slack notifications to the sales team.</p>

              <p><strong>Result:</strong> The sales team now gets real-time alerts and can track leads from intake to project without touching a
                spreadsheet. No more double entry or lost leads.</p>

              <div class="impact">

              <p><strong>Situation:</strong> The client's interior design team used Excel based vision boards to show FF&E (furniture, fixtures, and
                equipment) selections to customers. Gathering approvals and processing purchases involved back and forth emails, purchase orders, and
                manual customer signoffs causing delays and friction.</p>

              <p><strong>Task:</strong> Create a streamlined, interactive shopping cart experience from Excel based vision boards that allows
                customers to review, approve, and pay for items directly—reducing revision cycles and manual processing time.</p>

              <p><strong>Action:</strong> We integrated GatherIt, an FF&E specification tool, with a custom frontend shopping cart. Designers could
                upload product selections from Excel, and customers could instantly give feedback, request changes, or proceed to checkout and
                payment, all in one place.</p>

              <p><strong>Result:</strong> The revision process was cut from weeks to days. Customers could easily approve or decline items, and
                designers could instantly update the cart. The checkout flow replaced traditional purchase orders and signatures, making the entire
                process smoother for their customers and staff.</p>
