            <div class="project-details">
              <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Ironsmith had 15 years of business-critical data locked in a legacy Microsoft Access system with a
                complex, inconsistent schema.</p>
              <p><strong>Task:</strong> Migrate hundreds of thousands of rows‚Äîmany with broken or outdated relationships‚Äîinto a modern AWS-hosted
                PostgreSQL database, all without disrupting business operations.</p>
              <p><strong>Action:</strong> We built a robust Python migration pipeline to extract CSV data from Access, clean and reconstruct
                relationships, validate against a local PostgreSQL schema, and deploy with a one-command script to AWS.</p>
              <p><strong>Result:</strong> Seamless launch of their new system with all historical data intact and cleanly structured‚Äîno downtime, no
                data loss.</p>
              <div class="impact">

              <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Ironsmith‚Äôs previous agency left their modernization project incomplete, leaving critical gaps in
                business systems and no integration between their internal tools and customer website.</p>
              <p><strong>Task:</strong> Deliver an end-to-end solution: a custom business portal, a modern integrated WordPress site, a desktop app
                for server file access, and a full migration from legacy systems.</p>
              <p><strong>Action:</strong> We built a cloud-based portal with complex quote workflows, developed a public-facing site synced to product
                data, created a desktop bridge app for opening server files in native programs, and migrated 15+ years of legacy data from Access to
                PostgreSQL.</p>
              <p><strong>Result:</strong> Ironsmith now manages quotes, orders, and internal data seamlessly with full control over product
                presentation and file access‚Äîfinally delivering the system they had envisioned.</p>

              <p><strong>Situation:</strong> The client relied on Google Sheets for fast, flexible estimating‚Äîbut the exported PDFs looked amateur and
                didn't reflect their brand quality.</p>
              <p><strong>Task:</strong> Keep the speed and calculation power of Sheets, but output clean, on-brand PDFs that leave a strong impression
                with customers.</p>
              <p><strong>Action:</strong> We built a custom script that takes Google Sheet data and auto-fills a professionally designed PDF template
                with all estimate details and line items.</p>
              <p><strong>Result:</strong> The company now sends out polished, branded estimates in seconds‚Äîboosting trust and helping them close more

              <p><strong>Task:</strong> Create a seamless bridge between a modern web portal and an on-site file server without sacrificing cloud
                benefits.</p>
              <p><strong>Action:</strong> We built a lightweight Python desktop app using PyQT that could be triggered from the browser, enabling
                users to open local folders in File Explorer and launch native apps like AutoCAD.</p>
              <p><strong>Result:</strong> Users retained critical desktop file access while benefiting from all the advantages of a modern web-based
