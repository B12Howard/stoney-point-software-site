        <h2>5 Security Settings Every Business Should Enable in Google Workspace</h2>
        
        <p>
          Google Workspace is powerful but out of the box, it's not configured for maximum security. Many businesses 
          leave critical security settings disabled, exposing themselves to data breaches, phishing attacks, and 
          unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <p>Here are 5 essential security settings every business should enable:</p>

        <h3>1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>What it does:</strong> Requires a second verification step (like a phone code) in addition to passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Even if someone steals your password, they can't access your account without 
          the second factor. This stops 99% of automated attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to enable:</strong> In Google Admin Console → Security → 2-Step Verification → enforce for all users.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Advanced Phishing and Malware Protection</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>What it does:</strong> Scans attachments and links for malicious content before they reach your inbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Phishing is the #1 way hackers get into business systems. This setting blocks 
          suspicious emails automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to enable:</strong> In Google Admin Console → Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Safety → Enable 
          advanced phishing and malware protection.
        </p>

        <h3>3. External Sharing Controls</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>What it does:</strong> Prevents employees from accidentally sharing sensitive documents outside your organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> One wrong click can expose confidential client data, financial records, or 
          proprietary information to the public internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to enable:</strong> In Google Admin Console → Apps → Google Workspace → Drive and Docs → Sharing 
          settings → Restrict external sharing or require approval.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Session Length Limits</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>What it does:</strong> Automatically logs users out after a period of inactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> If an employee leaves their computer unlocked at a job site or coffee shop, 
          this prevents unauthorized access to your business data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to enable:</strong> In Google Admin Console → Security → Access and data control → Google session control.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Mobile Device Management (MDM)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>What it does:</strong> Lets you require passwords on mobile devices, remotely wipe lost phones, and 
          control what data can be accessed on personal devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Your employees access business email and documents from their phones. If they 
          lose their phone, you need to be able to protect your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to enable:</strong> In Google Admin Console → Devices → Mobile & endpoints → Settings → enforce 
          device policies.
        </p>

        <h3>Bonus: Regular Security Audits</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond these settings, you should regularly review:
        </p>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
          <li>Who has admin access (should be limited to 1-2 people)</li>
          <li>Which third-party apps have access to your data</li>
          <li>Which users have access to sensitive files and folders</li>
          <li>Login activity reports to spot unusual access patterns</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Need Help?</h3>
        <p>
          Setting up these security features correctly takes time and technical knowledge. Many business owners don't 
          have hours to spend navigating Google Admin settings.
