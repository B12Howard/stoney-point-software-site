        <h2>Stop Losing Leads: How to Automate Your Lead Capture</h2>
        
        <h3>The Problem: Leads Fall Through the Cracks</h3>
        <p>
          You're running Facebook ads. You're on Angi. You have a contact form on your website. Leads are coming in but 
          they're scattered across different platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone has to manually check each source, copy data into your CRM, and notify the sales team. By the time 
          you get around to it, <strong>the lead has already gone with a competitor who responded faster.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>This is a common problem for contractors and home service businesses and it's costing you thousands in lost revenue.</p>

        <h3>The Solution: Automated Lead Capture</h3>
        <p>
          When a lead comes in from <em>any source</em>, it should automatically flow into your CRM and notify your team 
          in real-time. No manual copying. No missed opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>Here's what a good lead automation system looks like:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Lead submits form</strong> (Google Forms, Facebook Lead Ads, Angi, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Data flows into CRM</strong> (Pipedrive, HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.) automatically</li>
          <li><strong>Team gets notified</strong> instantly via Slack, SMS, or email</li>
          <li><strong>Follow-up begins</strong> within minutes, not hours or days</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Real-World Example: Contractor Lead Automation</h3>
        <p>
          We built this exact system for a contractor who was juggling leads from Google Forms, Angi, and Facebook. 
          They were manually entering data and missing leads in the chaos.
        </p>
        <p>After implementing automated lead capture:</p>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
          <li><strong>Zero missed leads</strong> – everything flows into their CRM automatically</li>
          <li><strong>Instant notifications</strong> – sales team gets Slack alerts within seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Faster response times</strong> – they respond to leads while competitors are still checking email</li>
          <li><strong>Better tracking</strong> – they can see exactly where leads come from and what converts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits of Lead Automation</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
          <li><strong>Never Miss a Lead:</strong> Every lead is captured, even if it comes in at 11pm</li>
          <li><strong>Respond Faster:</strong> First response wins be the first to contact new leads</li>
          <li><strong>Save Time:</strong> No more manual data entry or checking multiple platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Better Tracking:</strong> See which lead sources actually convert to sales</li>
          <li><strong>Improve Close Rates:</strong> Faster, more organized follow-up means more closed deals</li>

        <h3>What It Costs</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Initial Setup:</strong> Starting at $2,500 (depends on number of lead sources and complexity)
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ROI:</strong> If you close just <em>one extra deal per month</em> because of faster response times, 
          this system pays for itself many times over.
        </p>
