        <p><strong>Before:</strong> Staff manually created Google Sheet quotes, copying data from emails and handwritten notes — prone to errors and wasted time.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We built a dynamic form system that automatically generated templated quotes, version-tracked changes, and routed approvals via email.</p>
