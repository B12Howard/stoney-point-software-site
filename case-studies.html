                <strong>Situation:</strong> Manufacturing client Ironsmith had 15 years of business-critical data locked
                in a legacy Microsoft Access system with a complex, inconsistent schema.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Task:</strong> Migrate hundreds of thousands of rows many with broken or outdated
                relationships into a modern AWS-hosted PostgreSQL database.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Action:</strong> We built a migration pipeline to extract CSV data from Access, clean and
                reconstruct relationships, validate against a local PostgreSQL schema, and deploy with a one command
                script to AWS.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Result:</strong> Seamless launch of their new system with all historical data intact and cleanly

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Task:</strong> Deliver an end-to-end solution: a custom business portal, an integrated WordPress
                site, a desktop app for on premise server file access, and a full migration from their legacy portal.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Action:</strong> We built a cloud-based portal with complex quote workflows, developed a
                public-facing site synced to product and project data, created a desktop bridge app for opening server
                files in native programs, and migrated 15+ years of legacy data from Microsoft Access to PostgreSQL.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Result:</strong> Ironsmith now manages quotes, orders, and internal data seamlessly with full
                control over product presentation and file access on a new system that does not crash and has 24 hour

                <strong>Situation:</strong> A home remodel company in Long Island used handwritten notes and manual
                spreadsheets to prepare quotes, often taking multiple days to finalize and send estimates to clients.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Task:</strong> Maintain the flexibility of Google Sheets but drastically reduce turnaround time
                and deliver polished, professional PDFs that matched the company's branding.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Action:</strong> We built a custom quoting system with all their product and pricing data, used
                Sheets to allow flexibility in adding services and products because of the complicated nature of the
                business. A script takes this estimate Sheet and creates a custom designed PDF.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Result:</strong> What used to take days now takes just a from a few minutes to at most a couple
                hours.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Action:</strong> We built a lightweight Python desktop app using PyQT that could be triggered
                from the browser, enabling users to open local folders in File Explorer and launch native apps like
                AutoCAD.

                <strong>Situation:</strong> A contractor had leads data coming from multiple sources: Angi, Facebook,
                Google Forms, and their website. Manual entry slowed down their team and introduced errors sometimes
                even causing them to miss incoming leads.

              <p>
                <strong>Task:</strong> Build something simple to funnel all these sources to their CRM and communcation

              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Action:</strong> We built an integration pipeline that connects Google Forms, Angi's API, and
                Wordpress to Pipedrive. From there, the data flows into their internal quote management system and
                triggers Slack notifications to the sales team.

              <p>
                <strong>Result:</strong> The sales team now gets real-time alerts and can track leads from intake to

                <strong>Situation:</strong> The client's interior design team used Excel based vision boards to show
                FF&E (furniture, fixtures, and equipment) selections to customers. Gathering approvals and processing
                purchases involved back and forth emails, purchase orders, and manual customer signoffs causing delays
                and friction.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Task:</strong> Create a streamlined, interactive shopping cart experience from Excel based
                vision boards that allows customers to review, approve, and pay for items directly reducing revision

              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Action:</strong> We integrated GatherIt, an FF&E specification tool, with a custom frontend
                shopping cart. Designers could upload product selections from Excel, and customers could instantly give
                feedback, request changes, or proceed to checkout and payment, all in one place.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Result:</strong> The revision process was cut from weeks to days. Customers could easily approve
                or decline items, and designers could instantly update the cart. The checkout flow replaced traditional
                purchase orders and signatures, making the entire process smoother for their customers and staff.

          "This app has been a game changer for my warehouse and distribution center. Previously, all of our displays
          were inventoried on paper and no records were kept, causing us to lose track of displays easily. Using the
          app, we can now easily see our on-hands, shift inventory between warehouses to cover gaps, and keep more
          comprehensive records of what is coming into and going out of the branch. Highly recommend!"
