      <h2>When Off the Shelf Software Doesn't Fit</h2>

    <section class="content">
      <h3>Your business isn't generic. Your software shouldn't be either.</h3>
      <p>
        Shopify doesn't work for your custom manufacturing quotes. QuickBooks can't handle your complex project workflows. 
        Generic CRMs don't match how your team actually operates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We build custom digital tools that match how your business actually works.</strong> Whether it's a business 
        portal for managing operations, a custom quoting system, or a specialized shopping cart for unique use cases we create 
        tools that fit your process, not force you to change your process to fit the software.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the best part? Our custom tools integrate with your existing software stack (CRM, accounting, Google Workspace, etc.) 
        so everything works together seamlessly.

      <h2>Real-World Example</h2>

    <section class="content">
      <h3>Complete Business System: From Legacy to Modern</h3>
      <p>
        Ironsmith, a manufacturing company, was stuck on a 15-year-old Microsoft Access system that crashed regularly. 
        Their previous agency abandoned a half-finished modernization project, leaving them with nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We built them a complete business system from scratch:
      </p>
      <ul class="custom-bullets">
        <li>Cloud-based business portal for managing quotes, orders, and operations</li>
        <li>Integrated WordPress website synced to their product catalog</li>
        <li>Desktop app to access on-premise file servers from the web portal</li>
        <li>Migrated 15 years of legacy data from Microsoft Access to PostgreSQL</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Result:</strong> Ironsmith now has a modern, reliable system that doesn't crash, supports their entire 
        operation, and has 24-hour support. They control their data and can finally scale their business.
